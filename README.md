# Simple C++ Heap Implementation

This is a simple C++ implementation of a heap data structure with an example priority queue implementation. main.cpp will intake a list from heapdata.txt and output an ordered list of members who opt-in to a program.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Program uses g++ to compile.

### Installing

**LINUX**
* The program will compile with the 'g++' command and will execute with './a.out'.

**WINDOWS**
* You will need to download and install MinGW if you do not already have it. This is needed to run g++ on the Windows command line interface.
* After this is installed, you can use the same commands as the Linux instructions to get the program up and running.
